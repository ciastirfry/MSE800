This is a simple command-line implementation of the word-guessing game using **Python** and **NumPy**.

## How It Works

- A random word is selected from a predefined list.
- The player guesses one letter at a time.
- Correct guesses reveal letters in the word.
- Incorrect guesses reduce the number of lives.
- The game ends when:
  - The player correctly guesses all the letters, or
  - The player runs out of lives.

## Running the Game

1. Make sure you have Python and NumPy installed:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python word_guess.py
   ```
