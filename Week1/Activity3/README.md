# Rainfall Analysis with NumPy
## Week 1 - Activity 3  
### Student Activity Summary

This Python script demonstrates basic data analysis using NumPy by analyzing rainfall data for one week.

---

### Dataset:
Sample rainfall (in millimeters):  
```python
[0.0, 5.2, 3.1, 0.0, 12.4, 0.0, 7.5]
```

---

### Tasks Completed:

- Converted a Python list to a NumPy array
- Printed the rainfall array
- Calculated total rainfall
- Computed average rainfall
- Counted days with no rainfall (0 mm)
- Found indices where rainfall > 5 mm
- Calculated the 75th percentile of rainfall data
- Identified values above the 75th percentile

---

### Technologies Used:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy

---

### How to Run:

1. Install NumPy (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install numpy
```

2. Run the script using:
```bash
python rainfall_analysis.py
```

### ðŸ“˜ Learning Outcome:
Through this activity, I practiced:
- Basic NumPy operations
- Array manipulation and filtering
- Real-world data analysis techniques
- Understanding percentiles in datasets
