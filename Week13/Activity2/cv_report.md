### **NZ Market Fit**
*   **Keywords Valued:** AWS, Azure, DevOps Engineer, Platform Engineer, SRE, Cloud Migration, IaC, Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD, Automation, Python, Cost Optimization, Observability, Agile. His recent NZ Master's study is a significant local credential.
*   **ATS Polish Tips:**
    *   **Clarity on "Current Role":** The 07/2025 end date for Standard Chartered Bank needs immediate clarification on whether he is still employed, on leave, or if this is a projected end to employment. This impacts work rights and availability.
    *   **Early Career Condensing:** Consider significantly shortening or removing pre-2014 roles (e.g., Desktop Support, UAT PCO) to emphasize the strong DevOps/Cloud journey.
    *   **Work Rights:** Explicitly state NZ work visa status/eligibility for part-time and full-time work.
    *   **Quantify More:** While he has strong achievements, add more numbers/impact for earlier DevOps roles if possible.

### **Risks / Red Flags**
*   **Availability/Commitment:** The primary "risk" is his current pursuit of a Master's degree and initial preference for flexible/part-time roles, which may not align with all full-time hiring needs. However, his clear intent to transition to full-time post-graduation mitigates this for roles willing to be flexible initially.
*   **Current Employment Status:** Ambiguity around his current employment with Standard Chartered Bank (given the future end date) requires clarification.
*   **No other significant red flags.** He shows long tenure at major banks, a clear career progression into DevOps, and strong technical skills.

### **Next Actions**
1.  **Clarify Current Employment:** Confirm exact employment status with Standard Chartered Bank and current work eligibility in NZ.
2.  **Refine Summary:** Tailor the professional summary to clearly state NZ work rights, current Master's study, and the part-time/flexible availability with a full-time future goal.
3.  **Condense Early Roles:** Advise shortening or removing pre-2014 roles to streamline the CV and focus on relevant DevOps/Cloud experience.
4.  **Add GitHub/Portfolio:** If available, include a link to a GitHub profile or portfolio demonstrating IaC/scripting work.
5.  **Target Role Customization:** Encourage tailoring the summary and achievements slightly for specific job descriptions (e.g., SRE vs. Platform Engineer).
6.  **Highlight NZ Study:** Emphasize the Master of Software Engineering from Yoobee College, Auckland, showing local commitment and continued learning.
7.  **Leverage "AI & Automation Tools":** If he has practical experience with these, suggest weaving them into specific project achievements rather than just listing as a skill.
