This project simulates a logistics dispatch center for Auckland Port using Singleton and Factory design patterns. The **LogisticsCenter** (Singleton) acts as the sole interface for managing cargo deliveries, while the **LogisticsFactory** (Factory) dynamically instantiates the appropriate transport mode (road or sea) based on input. The design promotes centralized control and extensibility â€” ideal for future expansion to air, rail, or drone logistics.
